Data quality profiling and exploratory data analysis are crucial steps in the process of Data Science and Machine Learning development. 
YData-profiling is a leading tool in the data understanding step of the data science workflow as a pioneering Python package. 

`ydata-profiling` is a leading package for data profiling, that automates and standardizes the generation of detailed reports, 
complete with statistics and visualizations. The significance of the package lies in how it streamlines the process of
understanding and preparing data for analysis in a single line of code! If you're ready to get started see the [quickstart](getting-started/quickstart.md)!

!!! tip "Profiling and scale and for databases"
    
    Take your data profiling to the next level - try ydata-profiling at scale and for databases! 
    
    Experience enterprise-level scalability and database support while enjoying the familiar open-source features you love. 
    Dive into large datasets with ease and ensure data quality like never before. Try [YData Fabric community version](https://ydata.ai/register)!

## Why use ydata-profiling?

`ydata-profiling` is a valuable tool for data scientists and analysts because it streamlines EDA, provides comprehensive insights, enhances data quality,
and promotes data science best practices.

- **Simple to user**: It is so **simple to use** - a single line of code is what you need to get you started. *Do you really need more to convince you?* 😛
```python linenums="1"
import pandas as pd
from ydata_profiling import ProfileReport

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
profile = ProfileReport(df, title="Profiling Report")
```
- **Comprehensive insights in a report**: a report including a wide range of statistics and visualizations, 
providing a holistic view of your data. The report is shareable as a html file or while integrate as a widget in a Jupyter Notebook. 
- **Data quality assessment**: excel at the identification of missing data, duplicate entries and outliers. These insights are essential
for data cleaning and preparation, ensuring the reliability of your analysis and leading to early problems' identification.
-  **Ease of integration with other flows**: all metrics of the data profiling can be consumed in a standard JSON format.
- **Data exploration for large datasets**: even with dataset with a large number of rows, `ydata-profiling` will be able to help you
as it supports both Pandas Dataframes and [Spark Dataframes](integrations/pyspark.md).
