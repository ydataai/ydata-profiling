New in v2.6.0
-------------

Dependency policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The current dependency policy is suboptimal.
Pinning the dependencies is great for reproducibility (high guarantee to work), but on the downside requires frequent maintenance and introduces compatibility issues with other packages.
Therefore, we are moving away from pinning dependencies and instead specify a minimum version.

Pandas v1
^^^^^^^^^
Early releases of pandas v1 demonstrated many regressions that broke functionality (as acknowledged by the authors `here <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/31523)>`_. At this point, pandas is more stable and we notice high demand for compatibility. We move on to support pandas' latest versions.
To ensure compatibility with both versions, we have extended the test matrix to test against both pandas 0.x.y and 1.x.y.

Python 3.6+ features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Python 3.6 introduces ordered dicts and f-strings, which we now rely on.
This means that from pandas-profiling 2.6, you should minimally run Python 3.6.
For users that for some reason cannot update, you can use pandas-profiling 2.5.0, but you unfortunately won't benefit from updates or maintenance.

Extended continuous integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Starting from this release, we use Github Actions and Travis CI combined to increase maintainability.
Travis CI handles the testing, Github Actions automates part of the development process by running black and building the docs.

Support pandas-profiling
