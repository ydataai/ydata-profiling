`ydata-profiling` primary goal is to provide a one-line Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) experience in a consistent and fast solution. Like pandas `df.describe()` function, that is so handy, ydata-profiling delivers an extended analysis of a DataFrame while allowing the data analysis to be exported in different formats such as **html** and **json**.

The package outputs a simple and digested analysis of a dataset, including **time-series** and **text**.

> **Looking for a scalable solution that can fully integrate with your database systems?**<br>
> Leverage YData Fabric Data Catalog to connect to different databases and storages (Oracle, snowflake, PostGreSQL, GCS, S3, etc.) and leverage an interactive and guided profiling experience in Fabric. Check out the [Community Version](http://ydata.ai/register?utm_source=ydata-profiling&utm_medium=documentation&utm_campaign=YData%20Fabric%20Community).

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Quickstart

### Install
```cmd
pip install ydata-profiling
```
or
```cmd
conda install -c conda-forge ydata-profiling
```
### Start profiling

Start by loading your pandas `DataFrame` as you normally would, e.g. by using:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from ydata_profiling import ProfileReport

df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.rand(100, 5), columns=["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"])
```

To generate the standard profiling report, merely run:

```python
profile = ProfileReport(df, title="Profiling Report")
```

## üìä Key features

- **Type inference**: automatic detection of columns' data types (*Categorical*, *Numerical*, *Date*, etc.)
- **Warnings**: A summary of the problems/challenges in the data that you might need to work on (*missing data*, *inaccuracies*, *skewness*, etc.)
- **Univariate analysis**: including descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, etc) and informative visualizations such as distribution histograms
- **Multivariate analysis**: including correlations, a detailed analysis of missing data, duplicate rows, and visual support for variables pairwise interaction
- **Time-Series**: including different statistical information relative to time dependent data such as auto-correlation and seasonality, along ACF and PACF plots.
- **Text analysis**: most common categories (uppercase, lowercase, separator), scripts (Latin, Cyrillic) and blocks (ASCII, Cyrilic)
- **File and Image analysis**: file sizes, creation dates, dimensions, indication of truncated images and existence of EXIF metadata
- **Compare datasets**: one-line solution to enable a fast and complete report on the comparison of datasets
- **Flexible output formats**: all analysis can be exported to an HTML report that can be easily shared with different parties, as JSON for an easy integration in automated systems and as a widget in a Jupyter Notebook.

The report contains three additional sections:

- **Overview**: mostly global details about the dataset (number of records, number of variables, overall missigness and duplicates, memory footprint)
- **Alerts**: a comprehensive and automatic list of potential data quality issues (high correlation, skewness, uniformity, zeros, missing values, constant values, between others)
- **Reproduction**: technical details about the analysis (time, version and configuration)

## üìù Use cases
YData-profiling can be used to deliver a variety of different use-case. The documentation includes guides, tips and tricks for tackling them:

| Use case | Description                                                                                 |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Comparing datasets](https://docs.profiling.ydata.ai/latest/features/comparing_datasets)                        | Comparing multiple version of the same dataset                                              |
| [Profiling a Time-Series dataset](https://docs.profiling.ydata.ai/latest/features/time_series_datasets)               | Generating a report for a time-series dataset with a single line of code                    |
|[Profiling large datasets](https://docs.profiling.ydata.ai/latest/features/big_data)                            | Tips on how to prepare data and configure `ydata-profiling` for working with large datasets |
| [Handling sensitive data](https://docs.profiling.ydata.ai/latest/features/sensitive_data)                       | Generating reports which are mindful about sensitive data in the input dataset              |
| [Dataset metadata and data dictionaries](https://docs.profiling.ydata.ai/latest/features/metadata)               | Complementing the report with dataset details and column-specific data dictionaries         |
| [Customizing the report's appearance](https://docs.profiling.ydata.ai/latest/features/custom_reports) | Changing the appearance of the report's page and of the contained visualizations            |
| [Profiling Databases](https://docs.profiling.ydata.ai/latest/features/collaborative_data_profiling) | For a seamless profiling experience in your organization's databases, check [Fabric Data Catalog](https://ydata.ai/products/data_catalog), which allows to consume data from different types of storages such as RDBMs (Azure SQL, PostGreSQL, Oracle, etc.) and object storages (Google Cloud Storage, AWS S3, Snowflake, etc.), among others. |
### Using inside Jupyter Notebooks

There are two interfaces to consume the report inside a Jupyter notebook: through widgets and through an embedded HTML report.

<img alt="Notebook Widgets" src="https://ydata-profiling.ydata.ai/docs/master/assets/widgets.gif" width="800" />

The above is achieved by simply displaying the report as a set of widgets. In a Jupyter Notebook, run:

```python
profile.to_widgets()
```

The HTML report can be directly embedded in a cell in a similar fashion:

```python
profile.to_notebook_iframe()
```

<img alt="HTML" src="https://ydata-profiling.ydata.ai/docs/master/assets/iframe.gif" width="800" />

### Exporting the report to a file

To generate a HTML report file, save the `ProfileReport` to an object and use the `to_file()` function:

```python
profile.to_file("your_report.html")
```

Alternatively, the report's data can be obtained as a JSON file:

```python
# As a JSON string
json_data = profile.to_json()

# As a file
profile.to_file("your_report.json")
```

### Using in the command line

For standard formatted CSV files (which can be read directly by pandas without additional settings), the `ydata_profiling` executable can be used in the command line. The example below generates a report named *Example Profiling Report*, using a configuration file called `default.yaml`, in the file `report.html` by processing a `data.csv` dataset.

```sh
ydata_profiling --title "Example Profiling Report" --config_file default.yaml data.csv report.html
```

Additional details on the CLI are available [on the documentation](https://ydata-profiling.ydata.ai/docs/master/pages/getting_started/quickstart.html#command-line-usage).
