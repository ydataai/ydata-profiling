History
=======

The ``pandas-profiling`` project became what it is today, due to the
work of the creators to make it successful. This page aims to highlights
a bit of the development history. For the full picture, have a look at
the `contributor
history <https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling/graphs/contributors>`__.

Inception
---------

During an internship at AXA Bank around forecasting and stress-testing
of pension plan portfolios, as a young intern, `Jos
Polfliet <https://www.linkedin.com/in/jos-polfliet/>`__ was asked to
research and propose a programming language to write this in. Back then,
Python was not as well-known and definitely not an obvious choice for a
large bank. He argued that NumPy and scikit-learn made Python the best
choice and happily, they trusted him. 🐍🐍 This choice set Jos on the path
that would eventually lead to developing pandas-profiling 🐼⭐

In 2016, Jos launched pandas-profiling to generate profile reports from
a pandas DataFrame. The idea was to enable the user to perform serious
exploratory data analysis, beyond what the ``df.describe()`` function
was offering.

Second life
-----------

Since May 2019, principal development has been taken over by `Simon
Brugman <https://linkedin.com/in/simonbrugman>`__. The startup that he
co-founded was an early adopter of the package, and he heavily invested
in growing the package with experience brought from using it in the
industry. Simon led the package through a huge refactor (99.5% was
changed) and two major releases, and great collaborations, notably with
`Ian Eaves <https://github.com/ieaves>`__ in
`visions <https://github.com/dylan-profiler/visions>`__.

Where are we now?
-----------------

At the time of writing, ``pandas-profiling`` is one of the primary tools
for data exploration in python, with > 8k Github stars, 30 million
downloads and users working in any industry, including many at FAANG,
banks and insurance companies, startups, universities. pandas-profiling
has been named one of the Top 20 ML packages by Google.

What’s next?
------------

Pandas Profiling will be part of a bigger mission, the Data-Centric AI
movement spearheaded by YData. The tech startup, YData, will be the
prominent force that will help make Pandas Profiling the standard
profiling library among data scientists introducing more features,
bigger team and enterprise support.
