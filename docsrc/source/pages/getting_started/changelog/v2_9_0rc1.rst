🎉 Features
^^^^^^^^^^^
- Working with sensitive data: Introduced ``sensitive=True`` option to mask non-aggregated data (such as samples, duplicates, frequency tables for categorical columns) [`#503 <https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling/issues/503>`_].
- The sample section can be parametrized with a custom sample (for instance mock data).
- Introduce shorthands for groups of parameters for styles and explorative mode [`#499 <https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling/issues/499>`_].
- Metadata of a dataset can be added to the report (see documentation).
- Numeric columns now report monotonicity information.
- A pie chart can be generated for boolean and (low) categorical columns.

🐛 Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^^^^
- NaT in date columns were interpreted as a date in 1680 by histograms [`#507 <https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling/issues/507>`_].
