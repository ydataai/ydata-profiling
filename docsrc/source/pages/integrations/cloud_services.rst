``pandas-profiling`` will be pre-installed on one of the `Lambda GPU Cloud <https://lambdalabs.com/>`_ images. Pandas Profiling itself does not provide GPU acceleration, but does support a workflow in which GPU acceleration is possible, e.g. this is a great setup for profiling your image datasets while developing computer vision applications.

``pandas-profiling`` is available in `Kaggle notebooks <https://www.kaggle.com/notebooks>`_ by default, as it is included in the `standard Kaggle image <https://github.com/Kaggle/docker-python/blob/master/Dockerfile>`_.
