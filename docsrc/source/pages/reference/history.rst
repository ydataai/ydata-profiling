History
=======

The ``ydata-profiling`` project became what it is today due to the
work of the creators to make it successful. This page aims to highlights
a bit of the development history. For the full picture, have a look at
the `contributor
history <https://github.com/ydataai/pandas-profiling/graphs/contributors>`__.

Inception
---------
In 2016, `Jos Polfliet`_ was working for SAS Institute and was getting
bored with doing the same types of exploratory data analysis over and
over again. Automating his own logic, he noticed it was useful and
decided to open-source it under the MIT License. The package was named
``pandas-profiling`` as a contraction of *pandas* and *data profiling*.
The idea was to enable the user to perform automated exploratory data
analysis, beyond what the ``df.describe()`` function was offering and by
abusing Jupyter's HTML output. Since that start, human years of
repetitive plotting and summary statistics have been saved from the
Machine Learning community.

Second life
-----------
Since May 2019, principal development has been taken over by `Simon
Brugman <https://linkedin.com/in/simonbrugman>`__. The startup that he
co-founded was an early adopter of the package, and he heavily invested
in growing the package with experience brought from using it in the
industry. Simon led the package through a huge refactor (99.5% was
changed) and two major releases, and great collaborations, most notably with
`Ian Eaves <https://github.com/ieaves>`__ in
`visions <https://github.com/dylan-profiler/visions>`__.

Profiling as part of Data-Centric AI
-----------
Since February 2022, YData as committed to continuous support and improvement
of ``pandas-profiling``. Our drive as maintainers of the package is to make data
scientist fall in love by the ease and quality of profiling
delivered by one of the best profiling packages.
Since 2022, `YData<https://ydata.ai/>`__ team have already delivered several new releases,
that included major features such as Time-Series
datasets analysis, compare of 2 datasets and most recently
integration with big data engine, Spark.

``pandas-profiling`` has been named one of the Top 20 ML packages by Google.

A huge thank you to 2 of the most iconic contributors who made possible
to compare 2 dataset `Simon Brugman <https://linkedin.com/in/simonbrugman>`__,
and to take the scale of profiling to another level with Spark `Edwin
Chan <https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwin-chan/>`__.

Where are we now?
-----------------
At the time of writing, ``pandas-profiling`` is receiving a new face and name
``ydata-profiling``. Derived from the most recent and major feature, Spark support,
we have decided to move from `pandas` to a name that opens the possibility of
new integrations and developments.

This is the most popular tool in the world for data exploration in Python, counting with > 10k Github stars,
50 million downloads and users working in any industry, including many at FAANG,
banks and insurance companies, startups and universities.

What's next?
------------
``ydata-profiling`` is committed to the mission of helping data-scientists to adopt
a Data-Centric approach towards the development of AI.
Continuous development and support will to be part of the development of
one of the most beloved open-sources by the data science community.

New features are expected and it will be important to learn from you your needs and expectations so the future can be even brighter.
