**Describe the bug**

<!--
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.
If the description consists of multiple non-related bugs, you are encouraged to create separate issues.
-->

**To Reproduce**

<!--
We would need to reproduce your scenario before being able to resolve it. 

_Data:_
Please share your dataframe. 
If the data is confidential, for example when it contains company-sensitive information, provide us with a synthetic or open dataset that produces the same error. 
You should provide the DataFrame structure, for example by reporting the output of `df.info()`. 
You can anonymize the column names if necessary.

_Code:_ Preferably, use this code format:
```python
"""
Test for issue XXX:
https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling/issues/XXX
"""
import pandas as pd
import pandas_profiling


def test_issueXXX():
    df = pd.read_csv(r"<file>")

    # Minimal reproducible code
```

**Version information:**

<!--
Version information is essential in reproducing and resolving bugs. Please report:

* _Python version_: Your exact Python version.
* _Environment_: Where do you run the code? Command line, IDE (PyCharm, Spyder, IDLE etc.), Jupyter Notebook (Colab or local)
* _`pip`_: If you are using `pip`, run `pip freeze` in your environment and report the results. The list of packages can be rather long, you can use the snippet below to collapse the output.
