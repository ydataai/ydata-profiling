Parameter,Type,Default,Description
``sort``,"None, asc or desc",None,"Sort the variables *asc* (ending), *desc* (ending) or *None* (leaves original sorting)."
``variables.descriptions``,dict,{},"Ability to display a description alongside the descriptive statistics of each variable ({'var_name': 'Description'})."
``vars.num.quantiles``,list[float],"[0.05,0.25,0.5,0.75,0.95]","The quantiles to calculate. Note that .25, .5 and .75 are required for the computation of other metrics (median and IQR)."
``vars.num.skewness_threshold``,integer,20,"Warn if the skewness is above this threshold."
``vars.num.low_categorical_threshold``,integer,5,"If the number of distinct values is smaller than this number, then the series is considered to be categorical. Set to 0 to disable."
``vars.num.chi_squared_threshold``,float,0.999,"Set to 0 to disable chi-squared calculation."
``vars.cat.length``,boolean,``True``,"Check the string length and aggregate values (min, max, mean, media)."
``vars.cat.characters``,boolean,``False``,"Check the distribution of characters and their Unicode properties. Often informative, but may be computationally expensive."

``vars.cat.imbalance_threshold``,float,0.5,"Warn if the imbalance score is above this threshold."
``vars.cat.n_obs``,integer,5,"Display this number of observations."
``vars.cat.chi_squared_threshold``,float,0.999,"Same as above, but for categorical variables."
``vars.bool.n_obs``,integer,3,"Same as above, but for boolean variables."
``vars.bool.imbalance_threshold``,float,0.5,"Warn if the imbalance score is above this threshold."
